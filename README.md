# COMPSYS306-Ass-1
Part 1 of the assignment for COMPSYS 306 - AI and Machine Learning

## Some notes about what some parts mean:
- feature extraction: does this mean we remove the *background* and look for
features?
	- not sure what these would be other than just putting in the pixels
- normalization and standardization: we would likely need to do this as all images have different value
ranges!
	- I'll do normalization as data does not follow standard distribution
	- Actually, could do HOG (in topic notes) instead - might actually use along with it as feature extraction?
